# Q17-TURBO (P2) 1.2.4</b><br>

<b>Q17-TURBO project (200W @ 8 Ohms).</b><br>

The natural evolution of the Q17-Mini, this time with two pairs of power transistors, better thermal management, better technical characteristics and the same sound signature with more punch.

An amplifier that will warm up even the coldest speakers.

These measurements were made with amateur measuring equipment. It is better to take them as an indication than as safe values.

<br>
The first version of the board was released on January, 6 2023.<br>
<br>
Version 1.2.4 was released on May 21, 2024.<br>
<br>
Version 1.2 introduces two major changes to the original Q17 schematic. A new Erno Borbely cascode type using JFET & depletion NMOS (Q7, Q8) has been added. Current mirror has been updated to a Wilson CCS with BS250 and NDC7003P (Q9 & U2). This evolution was made possible thanks to the help of Tiberiu Vicol which made it possible to evolve the original scheme towards new performances.<br>
<br>
This new version requires at least the soldering of one SMD component to be able to benefit from the use of a high-performance component to drive the Wilson Current Mirror circuit.<br>
