# Q17-SIGMA-PSU 1.1<br>

The Q17-SIGMA-PSU power supply is inspired by Ti Kan's Sigma22 circuit. 

The "sigma 22" is a high-performance DIY dual-rail, tracking, linear regulated power supply (PSU).

This power supply provides a regulated  up to 60vDC and 4A continuous source (or more with external heatsinks). The voltage difference between output and input is around 6V. The board should be able to power an amplifier board.

Version 1.1 published on April 22, 2024.

# This project is currently being tested and validated.
