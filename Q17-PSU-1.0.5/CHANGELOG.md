# Changelog Q17-PSU


Version [1.0.5] (25-09-2023)

- Updated ground plan et traces on PCB. I optimized the ground planes and tracks to minimize interference between the AC and DC part of the PCB.
- Don't use PCB below 1.0.5 version. They don't work (they produce hum).

Version [1.0.4] (6-09-2023)

- Updated trace for R1/C3 and R2/C4 on back PCB.

Version [1.0.3] (30-08-2023)

- Changed C1 and C2 for 10nF 100V COG (do not use MKP here with Saligny bridge).
- Updated schematic with available Mouser part number and datasheet links.
- Updated PCB for new C1 and C2 footprint (pitch of 5mm).
- Updated BOM.
