<b>Q17-Turbo project (200W @ 8 Ohms):</b>

The natural evolution of the Q17-Mini, this time with two pairs of power transistors, better thermal management with the same technical characteristics and the same sound signature.

The first version of the board was released on January, 6 2023.

Version 1.2.2 was released on September 4, 2023.

All files are located in Q17-TURBO-1.2 directory. Old version are located in Q17-TURBO Archives directory.

You can very simply manufacture your PCB via JLCPCB (https://jlcpcb.com) or PCBWay (https://www.pcbway.com) using the Gerber files available on this repository. You can also contact me, from time to time I have some spare copies of the Q17 PCBs that can be sold to you at cost price.
