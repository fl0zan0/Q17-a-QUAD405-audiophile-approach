# Q17-SIGMA-PSU 1.0<br>

The Q17-SIGMA-PSU power supply is inspired by Tin Kan's Sigma22. This power supply provides a regulated 50-60V and 5A continuous source (with external heatsinks). The voltage drop is less than 6 V (+10V for the original circuit limited to 30V). It should be able to power an amplifier board.

This project is currently being tested and validated.
